# Puppet - Mirror Trading Platform

Introduction to a new social financial instrument by Gambit/GMX DAO

Trading is accessible within a button click and driven by the stories of the "short-lived" success stories. if you've picked day trading, in the long period you will probably lose money

most traders are not profitable, and the statistic is worse for leverage traders. 97% have lost their absolute investment and in some cases, bankrupt them completley

Day Trading is one of world's hardest skill to ascertain, it requires the knowledge of learning risks, applying research, mitigating decisions based on emotions and understanding cycles/patterns. our platform accesses all of the trading activity that is happening on GMX, this allows the visibility of any trader's historic performance, we use the data to build a platform that allow it's users the ability to pick and choose traders that are likely to give them profit by mirroring their trading strategy.
a trader gets additional payment based on his performance and the amount of investors(puppets) mirroring his strategy, so traders are getting paid to trade(you heared it right), this has not been possible yet, until defi came to change the face of finance

We provide a symmetic risk and incentives for both trader and mirror investor, trader's use collateral in order to trade(on GMX) where Mirror(Puppets) stake liquidity into a mirror pool, choose multiple traders to mirror and set a threshold per trader(% of portfolio to trade)

> Defi 2.0 has been trending as the protocol owned liquidity. we think version 3.0 will step into harvesting powerful minds to work for the protocol for the shared benefits

Incentives

## GMX/Gambit DAO Incentive to implement this

GMX target Traders, where Puppet attracts investors that seek to transfer responsibility(the majority of wealth in the world is managed by professionals). fees that applied to traders will apply the same for mirror investors

The social part and mirroring feature incentivices traders to showcase their success on social platforms in order to get more investors to mirror their trading strategy
(? optional)Spending PR funds makes more sense because we target a broader audiance where GMX target traders
the competition is none, far as we know, we will be the first Mirror Trading platform ever built on the blockchain

(future)Implementing this feature could also be used internally(by composing internal mirror functionality) to take positions algorithmically on-chain based on top traders
